abstract: The heterogeneous Fenton process in the presence of Fe-containing
  minerals is ubiquitous in nature and widely deployed in wastewater treatment.
  While there have been extensive relevant studies, the dependence on pH of the
  nature and extent of oxidant generation and key reaction pathways remain
  unclear. Herein, the adsorption and decomposition of formate and H2O2 were
  quantified in the presence of ferrihydrite within the pH range of 3.0–6.0, and
  experiments with methyl phenyl sulfoxide were conducted to distinguish between
  HO• and weaker oxidant(s) which react via oxygen atom transfer including
  ferryl ion ([FeIVO]2+) and/or ferric hydroperoxo intermediates (≡FeIII(O2H)).
  Both HO• and [FeIVO]2+/≡FeIII(O2H) are concurrently produced on the surface
  over the acidic to near-neutral pH range. Despite the simultaneous formation
  of both oxidants, HO• is the major oxidant responsible for substrate oxidation
  in the interfacial boundary layer with [FeIVO]2+/≡FeIII(O2H) exhibiting
  limited exposure to substrates. With an increase of pH, the yield of both
  oxidants is inhibited by the decreasing availability of surface sites due to
  ferrihydrite particle aggregation. Increasing pH also favors the nonradical
  decay of H2O2 as evident from the consistent oxidant production rate relative
  to the surface area (SSA) despite an accelerated H2O2 decay rate relative to
  SSA with pH increase.
