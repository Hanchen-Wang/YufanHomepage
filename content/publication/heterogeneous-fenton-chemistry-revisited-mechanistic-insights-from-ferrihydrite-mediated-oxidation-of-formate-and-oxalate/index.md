abstract: The heterogeneous Fenton process has been widely applied though some
  aspects of this process are still poorly understood. In this study, we
  simultaneously quantify the adsorption and decomposition of formate and H2O2
  at pH 4.0 in the presence of freshly formed ferrihydrite and provide new
  insights into the ferrihydrite-induced heterogeneous Fenton mechanism with the
  aid of kinetic and reactive-transport modeling. Our results show that the
  decomposition of H2O2 and formate is controlled by surface-initiated
  reactions. Adsorbed formate occupies the surface sites otherwise available for
  reaction with H2O2 and therefore hampers the surface Fenton reactions despite
  the negligible accumulation of H2O2 on the surface. The minimal impact of
  methanol (an effective HO• scavenger) on formate oxidation as well as the poor
  oxidation of fully adsorbed oxalate compared with the ready oxidation of
  partially adsorbed formate demonstrates that oxidation mainly occurs in the
  solid–liquid boundary layer, rather than in bulk or on the surface. This is
  suggested to be due to the diffusion of surface-generated HO•, rather than
  surface Fe(II), to the boundary layer with the results of kinetic and
  reactive-transport modeling supporting this conclusion. The new findings are
  critical to our understanding of the removal behavior of more complex organic
  target species and to the design of more effective heterogeneous Fenton
  technologies.
