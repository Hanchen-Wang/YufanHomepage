abstract: Cu(II) enhanced the oxygen activation by Fe(II) to increase the yield
  of oxidants. However the factors controlling the catalytic performance and
  indeed the underlying influencing mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we
  presented the detailed study of Cu(II)-Fe(II) reactions for a range of pH and
  Cu(II)/Fe(II) ratios. From the results obtained, we provided insight into the
  factors controlling the redox reactions of Fe-Cu and the catalytic behaviours
  of active species. A reaction scheme for the Fe(II)/Cu(II) system was
  developed in which the in-situ formed Cu(I) mainly contributed to producing
  H2O2 and Fe(II) dominantly decomposed H2O2 to hydroxyl radical (HOradical dot)
  [see companion article] (Yufan Chen). Circumneutral conditions facilitated the
  catalytic processes; under acidic conditions, the reverse reaction between
  Fe(III) and Cu(I) was strongly favoured; alkaline conditions improved the
  reducing capacity, which subsequently enhanced the generation of Cu(0) instead
  of Cu(I). There was a saturated Cu(II)/Fe(II) ratio above which further
  addition of Cu(II) could not be reduced, and then excessive Cu(I) and Cu(II)
  consumed HOradical dot and O2radical dotâ€“, respectively. Therefore, the
  highest removal efficiency of organic pollutants was achieved when the
  stoichiometric Cu(II)/Fe(II) ratio was 60% at circumneutral pH. The new
  findings have implications for the treatment of mixed wastewater where copper
  and organic pollutants coexist.
