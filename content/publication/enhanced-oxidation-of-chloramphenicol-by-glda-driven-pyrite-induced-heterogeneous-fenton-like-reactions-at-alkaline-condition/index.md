abstract: The influence of a biodegradable agent, N,N-bis(carboxymethyl)glutamic
  acid (GLDA), on chloramphenicol (CAP) degradation in pyrite/H2O2 system was
  investigated. The results indicated that the presence of GLDA could extend the
  working pH range and provided favorable performance at alkaline conditions.
  The addition of 100 μmol/L GLDA increased the CAP removal rate to 83.3% at pH
  8 due to the reinforced formation of radical dotOH. The beneficial effect was
  found to be indifferent of possible reduction of redox potential
  (Fe(III)/Fe(II)), probable decrease of reaction pH and complex of structured
  iron on pyrite surface. However, it was correlated well with the facilitated
  autocatalytic oxidation reaction by Fe(III)-GLDA that promoted cycle of iron,
  which was confirmed by the determination of ESR and sulfate ion leaching.
  Based on GC–MS results, the presence of GLDA led to further oxidation of
  product with reinforced oxidation efficiency, and the potential degradation
  routine remains similar. All these provide some fundamental insights into the
  characteristics of environment friendly GLDA-enhanced pyrite/H2O2 system for
  bio-refractory contaminants removal under neutral or alkaline conditions, and
  enrich the theoretical knowledge of heterogeneous Fenton-like processes.
