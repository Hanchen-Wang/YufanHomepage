abstract: In this study, the novel combination of Fe3+ and FeS2/H2O2 system was
  used to enhance the degradation of chloramphenicol (CAP) by promoting the
  synergetic effect between the Fe3+ and the FeS2, and the kinetic models to
  elucidate the reaction mechanisms were validated. Raw pyrite samples were
  pretreated and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
  microscope, transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
  surface area analyzer. Studies on the effects of buffer solution and phosphate
  on the kinetics of CAP degradation revealed that the autocatalytic effect was
  associated with the dissolution and generation of Fe3+. As confirmed by the
  experiment to examine the Fe3+ mediated oxidation of FeS2, the catalytic
  improvement was due to the release of Fe2+ by the reaction between the FeS2
  and the Fe3+ at zero-order rate when the Fe3+ was excessively present. Kinetic
  models including surface-controlled activation and homogeneous Fenton
  reactions were responsible for the degradation of CAP.
