abstract: In this study, three GR/Cu(II) (Green Rust/Cu(II)) composites
  (GRSO4/Cu(II), GRCO3/Cu(II), and GRCl/Cu(II)) were synthesized and used to
  activate dioxygen under weakly acidic conditions. The change in the mechanism
  caused by three interlayer anions, CO32−, SO42−, and Cl−, was discussed for
  the first time. Both Cu(I) and H2O2 were generated during GR/Cu(II)-induced
  dioxygen activation, resulting in the rapid degradation of acetaminophen. The
  inconsistency between the reaction constant rates and oxidation reduction
  potential (ORP) order revealed the effects of the various types of interlayer
  ions. To further reveal the effects of the anions, the variations in the
  morphology and valence states of the composites were examined. To identify the
  rate-controlling step of dioxygen activation by the three composites, the
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated and compared. The
  combination of interlayer anions and metal ions changed the oxide morphology
  of the solid-phase materials. Furthermore, changes in the content of the
  reductive species (Fe(II) or Cu(I)) either enhanced or inhibited specific
  reaction steps. The results from this study could deepen our understanding of
  the effects of anions on dioxygen activation by transition metals and provide
  a basis for the study of oxidation reactions and mechanisms in the presence of
  various anions.
