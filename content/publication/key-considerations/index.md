abstract: Iron oxychloride (FeOCl) has been reported to be a highly efficient
  heterogeneous Fenton catalyst over a wide pH range. In order to determine the
  true catalytic performance of FeOCl, we simultaneously quantified the
  adsorptive and oxidative removal of formate, oxalate, and rhodamine-B (RhB)
  and the formation of RhB oxidation products at both pH 4.0 and 7.0. FeOCl was
  found to be a poor Fenton catalyst at either pH, as gauged by the oxidation of
  formate, oxalate, and rhodamine B and the decomposition of H2O2, in comparison
  with ferrihydrite (Fhy), one of the most common Fe-containing Fenton
  catalysts. The adsorption of target contaminants to FeOCl and homogeneous
  Fenton processes, induced by dissolved iron, resulted in overevaluation of the
  catalytic performance of FeOCl, especially for (i) the use of strongly
  adsorbing target compounds, without consideration of the role of adsorption in
  their removal and (ii) exceedingly high concentrations of H2O2 to remove trace
  quantities of target contaminants. Overall, this study highlights that the
  systematic quantification of H2O2 decomposition, target compound adsorption,
  and oxidation as well as the concentrations of oxidized products formed are
  prerequisites for unequivocal elucidation of the catalytic nature and reaction
  mechanism of solid Fenton catalysts.
