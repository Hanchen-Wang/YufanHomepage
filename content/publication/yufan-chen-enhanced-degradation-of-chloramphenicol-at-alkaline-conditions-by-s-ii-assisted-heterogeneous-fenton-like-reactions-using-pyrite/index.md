abstract: The Fenton-like reactions catalyzed by pyrite can efficiently degrade
  organic contaminants by oxidation process. When chloramphenicol (CAP) was
  exposed to the pyrite-H2O2 system, the CAP removal rate rapidly reached 100%
  however slowed to a halt at alkaline conditions. Results indicated that by
  adding S(-II) in pyrite-H2O2 system improved the oxidation efficiency of CAP
  at alkaline conditions. The transformation of S22− and Sn2− observed by X-ray
  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirmed that amorphous iron polysulfide
  (FeSn) was freshly generated on the pyrite surface. The availability of S(-II)
  promoted the generation of FeSn. Besides, S(-II) played a role in accelerating
  the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycles. The potential of S(-II) activating H2O2 to generate
  hydroxyl radicals (radical dotOH), which was confirmed by electron spin
  resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, quenching experiments, and trapping experiments,
  have supported the proposed mechanisms. This study came up with an efficient
  way of enhancing Fenton-like reactions by pyrite catalyzed at alkaline
  conditions, by adding S(-II) in the system. The new findings have implications
  for sulfide minerals, their interactions with pollutants, and the
  transformation products of sulfur in systems where Fe species are also
  present.
