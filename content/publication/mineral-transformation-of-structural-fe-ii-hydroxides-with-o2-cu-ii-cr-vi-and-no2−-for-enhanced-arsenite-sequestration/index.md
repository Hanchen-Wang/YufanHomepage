abstract: Structural Fe(II/III) hydroxides on the shell of nano-zerovalent iron
  (nZVI) are reactive sites for As(III) adsorption. Well-controlled structural
  Fe(II) hydroxides (SFH) is prepared to serve for As(III) removal in present
  study. With oxygen As(III) removal by SFH occurred efficiently but the removal
  efficiency was greatly reduced under anoxic conditions. The mineral
  transformation from SFH to lepidocrocite probably contributed to the robust
  removal efficiency of As(III). It is found that Cu(II), Cr(VI) and NO2− in
  aqueous solution could act as oxidants and promote the mineral transformation
  of SFH. A more efficient As(III) removal was therefore observed without
  oxygen. The removal efficiency decreased in the order O2/SFH ≈ Cu(II)/SFH >
  Cr(VI)/SFH ≈ NO2−/SFH at near neutral pH. The removal efficiency was less
  dependent on the initial pH for O2/SFH and Cu(II)/SFH systems than Cr(VI)/SFH
  and NO2−/SFH systems. Distribution of As on solid phases was able to describe
  the removal mechanism of As(III), and the results showed that the mineral
  transformation promoted the precipitation process and inhibited outer-sphere
  complexation, thus leading to enhanced As removal. With Cu(II), Cr(VI) and
  NO2−, the generation of oxidants from SFH transformation drove As(III)
  oxidation, and contributed to total As removal.
