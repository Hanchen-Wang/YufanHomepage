- Proved the major oxidation of substates in the interfacial boundary layer of ferrihydrite in the heterogeneous Fenton process with the aid of kinetic and reactive-transport modelling.
- Investigated the nature of reactive species including hydroxyl radical and weak oxidant formed in the heterogeneous Fenton process.
