I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in school of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales. I am supervised by Scientia Professor. [David Waite](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/scientia-professor-david-waite) (Fellow of the American Academy of Engineering) and Dr. [Christopher J. Miller](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-christopher-james-miller). I received my Bachelor degree in Environmental Engineering from Nanjing University in 2014 and my Master degree in Environmental Engineering from Tongji University in 2017.

My research focuses on water and wastewater treatment by advanced oxidation processes and kinetic modelling of reactive oxygen species.
